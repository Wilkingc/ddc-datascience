# Wilking Chali Alphonse - Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science project repository! This collection showcases my skills and experience in leveraging data to solve problems and extract meaningful insights. Here you'll find a variety of projects demonstrating my abilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and more.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Personality Ranking System (NLP)

**Description:**
This project explores the fascinating intersection of language and personality. By applying Natural Language Processing techniques, the system calculates the "distance" between different personality types based on textual data.

**Key Technologies:**
* Python
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* TextBlob
* Wikipedia API

**Key Features:**
* Automated text cleaning and preprocessing pipelines.
* Information retrieval from the Wikipedia API for personality descriptions.
* Sentiment analysis to understand the emotional tone associated with different personalities.
* Ranking of personalities based on their textual similarity using KNN.


### 2. Spotify Song Popularity Prediction

**Description:**
This supervised regression project focuses on predicting the popularity of songs based on their audio features. By building and evaluating machine learning models, the goal is to identify the key characteristics that contribute to a song's success.

**Key Technologies:**
* Python
* Machine Learning
* Decision Trees
* XGBoost
* Pandas
* Scikit-Learn
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Key Features:**
* Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the relationships between audio features and popularity.
* Implementation of Decision Tree and XGBoost models for prediction.
* Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to handle missing values and prepare the data for modeling.
* Evaluation of model performance using relevant regression metrics.


## How to Explore This Repository

Each project has its own dedicated directory containing:

* **Code:** Well-commented Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks.
* **Data:** (If publicly available or synthetic data is used)
* **Visualizations:** Any relevant charts or graphs generated during the analysis.

Feel free to browse the directories and explore the code and documentation.


Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I am always learning and working on new projects, so check back for updates.
